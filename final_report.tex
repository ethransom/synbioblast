% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{final_report_images/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png,.svg}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../final_report_images/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% Do NOT use the amsbsy package under comsoc mode as that feature is
% already built into the Times Math font (newtxmath, mathtime, etc.).
% 
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% Select a Times math font under comsoc mode or else one will automatically
% be selected for you at the document start. This is required as Communications
% Society journals use a Times, not Computer Modern, math font.
\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% The freely available newtxmath package was written by Michael Sharpe and
% provides a feature rich Times math font. The cmintegrals option, which is
% the default under IEEEtran, is needed to get the correct style integral
% symbols used in Communications Society journals. Version 1.451, July 28,
% 2015 or later is recommended. Also, do *not* load the newtxtext.sty package
% as doing so would alter the main text font.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
%
% Alternatively, you can use the MathTime commercial fonts if you have them
% installed on your system:
%\usepackage{mtpro2}
%\usepackage{mt11p}
%\usepackage{mathtime}


%\usepackage{bm}
% The bm.sty package was written by David Carlisle and Frank Mittelbach.
% This package provides a \bm{} to produce bold math symbols.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as,

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name

% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil

\begin{abstract}
By adding the ability to search the SynBioHub repository by nucleotide sequence,
rather than by title, keyword, or summary, users and administrators
gain the ability to investigate the uses of particular sequences
and see where uploaders utilized already existing components, without the need
for uploaders to have designed their SBOL correctly. Scraping SynBioHub to create a 
list of unique sequences can be done with a paginated SPARQL query. The source code
and executables for NCBI's BLAST are freely available, which allows us to build a 
BLAST database using these sequences. Finally, we can implement a user interface
that allows users to submit queries to BLAST against this database and view the 
results of these queries. A prototype has shown that this approach does not create
availability issues for SynBioHub's backing database, or is unfeasible to run 
on a single host machine.

SynBioHub uses the Virtuoso graph database to store application state, namely,
uploaded sequences. While Virtuoso provides operations to perform simple string
comparisons, these operations are not suitable for searching for and against large
strings. In addition, two components claiming to encode the same structure might 
have small differences consisting of single base pairs, or small prefixes or postfixes.
These differences do not change the charatcter of the DNA sequence, but would cause
the sequences to be rejected by simpler string comparision algorithms. This task requires
the use of alignment algorithms specifically designed to operate on DNA sequences. The
de facto standard in this space is NCBI's BLAST.

The BLAST algorithm was published in 1990 as a significant improvement upon existing search
alignment algorithms available at the time. BLAST gains its speed by sacrificing a dynamic
programming approach for a heuristic-based one. This approach is less accurate but is up to 50
times faster. BLAST's speed vastly improved the user experience of querying extremely large
databases, and has been extremely successful--the original paper has been cited 50,000 times,
making it the most cited paper of the 1990s.

\section{Methods}

The SynBioBLAST prototype is built in a layered, microservice-based 
fashion. Figure \ref{architecture} shows the architecture of SynBioBLAST.
An alternate architecture is discussed in the Future Work section.

\subsection{Scraping Virtuoso}

The Virtuoso Universal Server provides a number of functions, in particular,
a graph database with a SPARQL interface. SynBioHub exposes this interface 
at https://synbiohub.org/sparql, allowing for users to run a subset 
of SPARQL queries. This endpoint can also be configured as an API endpoint,
in which case it will return results in a well-known XML format. 

\subsubsection{Flattening the Graph}

The query used by the scraper to fetch sequences is shown in figure \ref{sparqlquery}.
It retrieves the URIs of all component definitions, and attaches to each URI the elements
of the sequence referenced by the component, as well as the creation time of the component.

      } ORDER BY ASC(str(?created))
    }
  }
  LIMIT {{.Limit}} OFFSET {{.Offset}}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The SPARQL query used to fetch sequences from Virtuoso.}
\label{sparqlquery}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Paginating}

Returning in one batch every sequence generated by the query would be
a strain on Virtuoso and the server processing the results of the query.
The query was converted into a scrollable cursor by sorting sequences based 
on the sort order of their creation time and wrapping it in a parent
query. 

Figure \ref{sparqlquery} shows placeholders for a query limit and offset.
The limit variable is used to control the batch size of the query. This number 
should be kept low enough that the load on Virtuoso is minimal. For the first 
query offset is 0. Additional queries can request a batch of sequences starting
after the Nth sequence by passing \texttt{OFFSET} as N.

The offset referred to by \texttt{OFFSET} is with respect to creation time, ascending.
(This is specified by the cursor query.) This sort is stable; sequences that are added
while scraping is ongoing will appear at the end of the cursor. 

Figure \ref{pagination} shows three example queries with \texttt{LIMIT} set to 4.

\subsubsection{Deduplication}

Because of the nature of flattening a graph into a flat XML file, sequences that
are referenced multiple times will appear multiple times in this output. Duplicates
need to be detected and handled appropriately. As an added benefit, sequences that 
were uploaded multiple times through user error will be deduplicated as well.

Deduplication is acheived through the use of the SHA1 hash function. Each sequence
is hashed. The hash of the sequence becomes the primary identifier of the sequence
from this point until just before BLAST query results are returned to the user. 
A FASTA file named \texttt{<hash>.fasta} containing the sequence, titled with
its hash, is written to a configurable directory.
For each sequence, the URI associated with it is added to
a Redis set keyed using the sequence hash. 

In this manner, a sequence that has been 
seen before will not result in a new FASTA file, but will associate its URI 
with the existing FASTA file by way of the sequence's Redis set. (Implementations 
could simply overwrite the FASTA file, as the properities of the hash function 
virtually guarantee that their contents will be identical. If desired, an implementation
could write the file to disk contingent on the file not being present.) 

\subsection{Building the BLAST database}

NCBI provides a number of programs to create, manipulate, and query BLAST databases.
One such program is \texttt{makeblastdb}, which assembles an input file of sequences
into an indexed BLAST database. 

The prototype scraper stores sequences individually, so that new sequences can be 
scraped incrementally. The builder script uses \texttt{cat} to concatenate these files
into the \texttt{stdin} of \texttt{makeblastdb}. The default Linux shell has a maximum
argument length of approximately 30,000, which is possibly less than the number of FASTA
files. This requires the use of the \texttt{find} command is used to enumerate the filenames
of the FASTA directory and run the \texttt{cat} command for each file. Figure \ref{builddb} 
shows a command similar to the one used to build the database.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
find -name '*.fasta' -exec cat {} \; 
  | ./makeblastdb -in -
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\texttt{find} is used to concatenate the FASTA files and pipe them to \texttt{makeblastdb}}
\label{builddb}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Running Queries}

SynBioBLAST is queried through a webpage user interface, similar to NCBI's reference
BLAST implementation. The basic data flow is shown in figure \ref{queryserver}. 
A webserver displays a form to the user. Users input their query 
sequence and submit the form. NCBI's \texttt{blastn} program is used to run the BLAST
algorithm on the indexed BLAST database. The output of \texttt{blastn} is collected 
and parsed. The query server then must perform reverse deduplication to convert SHA1
hashes back into lists of uris. A results page is then generated for the user, featuring
a link for each matching uri and selected hit information results as reported by the 
BLAST algorithm.


\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{queryserver}
\caption{The query server spawns a child \texttt{blastn} process which queries 
the BLAST database}
\label{queryserver}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reverse Deduplication}

Sequences are identified in the BLAST database by their SHA1 hash. These hashes
are used to assemble a list of keys to retrieve the url sets associated with each
sequence. An \texttt{SMEMBERS <key>} command is sent to Redis for each key. These
commands are pipelined, meaning the latency of deduplication is approximately the
round trip time to the Redis server, and is not dependent on the number of results
returned by BLAST.

\section{Results}

A Google Cloud Compute Engine \texttt{f1-micro} instance was provisioned to 
test the prototype. The instance had 8 GB of disk capacity and 592 MB of 
memory, both of which proved to be more than sufficient.

\subsection{Scraping}

Scraping was initially done in smaller batches of 100 or 1000. When Virtuoso 
handled those queries well, batch size was increased to 5000. Further experimentation
could determine the optimal value of this parameter. 

At a batch size of 5000, the scraper took roughly 3 minutes to scrape 36,607 sequences
from Virtuoso. Of these, 33,325 were unique (3,282 duplicates), resulting in 143 MB of
of FASTA files and 20 MB of Redis memory usage.

This resource usage was much less than expected, calling many of the design 
decisions into question and making new implementations and architectures feasible.
See the Future Work section for discussion of these possibilities.

\subsection{Building The Database}

As of this writing, building the BLAST database takes 39 seconds of real time 
and 2 seconds of user CPU time. Clearly, the bottleneck is retrieving the FASTA files from
disk. The 37 seconds of disk seek overhead could be virtually eliminated if the slurper
appended new sequences to a single FASTA file.

\subsection{Querying}

Running a 720 base pair query takes 218 ms. Fetching deduplication information
from Redis takes 13 ms, the remainder of the time is spent waiting for the BLAST
algorithm. A 5500 base pair query takes 450 ms, with 10 ms taken communicating 
with Redis. The time spent fetching deduplication information from Redis is 
considered minimal compared to the time of the query.



\subsection{Implementation}

The scraper and query server were both written in Go. Go is a statically-typed
complied language designed for web services and distributed systems. The current
scraper implementation is 274 lines, while the query implementation is 194. The 
database builder is a simple shell script, about 15 lines.


\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Improvements on the Existing Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    \underline{Performance.} As discussed above, modifing the scraping code to append new sequences to 
    a large file would speed up the building of the BLAST database by 10x. 
  \item
    \underline{User experience.} Figure \ref{blastexample} shows how BLAST displays
    hit regions for the results of a query. SynBioBLAST's results page is rudimentary
    at best. 
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{blastexample.jpg}
\caption{The official BLAST implementation has graphical hit region displays.}
\label{blastexample}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Alternative Architectures}

Scraping Virtuoso is fast enough that it could be done from scratch each time. 
This unlocks a number of alternative design paths.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \underline{Batch-based architecture.} The deduplication data structures
    are small enough that they could be built in-memory. (On the order of 
    tens of kilobytes.) The dependency on Redis could be removed, which would
    simplify deployment and system administration.
  \item
    \underline{ComponentDefinition-centric query.} If the deduplication of
    reuploaded sequences is not desired, a different query could be chosen 
    that preserves the many-to-one relationship between Sequences and 
    ComponentDefinitions. This would eliminate the need for deduplication
    data structures entirely.
  \item
    \underline{Sharded architecture.} The Scraping process could split 
    sequences into any number of sub databases. Queries would be run on all
    databases in parallel, and the results combined and resorted. The 
    NCBI official BLAST implementation uses this because the databases used
    are too large to fit on a single machine. This approach could also speed
    up queries. SynBioHub does not currently contain enough sequences for this
    to be helpful. 
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{shardedarchitecture}
\caption{A sharded architecture, where each server is responsible for a subset 
of the sequences.}
\label{sharding}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Rewriting in JavaScript}

The main SynBioHub application is written in JavaScript. Is it possible to 
integrate the Golang code by running the Scraper and Query Server as child
processes, maintainence could be simplified by rewriting in JavaScript. As 
both components are of low complexity and don't utilize any Golang-specific 
features, the rewrite would be a fairly 
direct translation. 

\section{Conclusion}


Due to the generosity of the BLAST authors and the capabilities of Virtuoso, 
adding heristic-based 
nucleotide search to applications is straightforward and relatively 
simple. This functionality allows for easy answers to a variety of research questions
and opens up new ways for SynBioHub administrators to curate and index their collections.
